**Info (please complete the following information):**
- iDevice's version: [iOS 15.7.1]
- Computer OS and version: [macOS 13.0]
- The command you ran: [sudo ./palera1n.sh --tweaks 15.7.1]

**Additional context**
Whenever I try to start the ./palerain.sh command to jailbreak, I put it in DFU mode, then It gives me an Unknown Error message. And the phone will exit DFU mode and go back into recovery mode. It does this everytime.
